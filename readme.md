# Intro

This is MVP for one of our client (UTSEUS) which helps teams on hackathons exchange skills among team members and pay for their help.  It has three modules: web client (React), server (NodeJS) and storage with some business logic on blockchain (ethereum). This doc descriebs how to setup environment and run server backed by blockchian. 

## Install environment

A whole environment is described in scripts of package.json. Almost all what you need is run this scripts from the server folder. 

```
npm run install
npm run testrpc
npm run truffle
# run server API tests
npm run test-mocha
# run unit tests
npm run test-jest
```

## Configure truffle.js

Use one of accounts from output of testrpc to put into this truffle.js configuration 

```
require('babel-register')
require('babel-polyfill')

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "localhost", 
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*",
      from: "0x041599451d9bac5bee252a5db569856085666f62",
      gas: 4712388
    }
  }
}
```
## Setup users
Both skills and users are preconfigured on the server. To setup users go to `utils.js` and put new data into array `users` 

## Setup skills
To setup users go to file `dataset.js` and fill data into variable `skills`

## Start the server
Move back to the server folder and execute this command

```
npm run start
```
